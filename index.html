        <h2>What do they entail?</h2>
        <h3>Web development</h3>
        <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications

             </ol>
        <h3>Data Science</h3>
        <p>Data science is the field of study that combines statistics, computer science,
             and domain knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data.</p>
        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage.
         It's all about keeping digital systems secure — from personal devices to large corporate or government systems.</p>
         <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
         <p>Artificial Intelligence is the branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines or systems that can 
            simulate human intelligence — like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.</p>
